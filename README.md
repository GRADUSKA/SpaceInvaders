# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders project for S4 EPITA.

This project was made for a class in the 4th semester of EPITA. It's written in Motorola 68k so you might have difficulties to install the dependencies.

If you have any questions send me a discord message at GRADUSKA#0112 or an email at antoine.thomas@epita.fr

I also did a bonus, a ball is moving fast and when you touch it, the ship is now shooting multiples times.

Have a good one !
