# SpaceInvaders
Space Invaders project for S4 EPITA
This project was made for a class in the 4th semester of EPITA. It's written in Motorola 68k so you might have difficulties to install the dependencies.

I did a Bonus where a little ball is moving and when you shoot it, your ship upgrade and you have 3 shoots.
